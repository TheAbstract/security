digital security guidelines in a world of mass surveillance.
these guidelines are not exhaustive, just things that should be seriously considered by anyone who cares about privacy and security.
be mindful that surveillance may come from both state and corporate actors. 

## pre-requisites

read the electronic frontier foundation's [surveillance self-defence resource](https://ssd.eff.org) page. 
this should be your main source for the most up to date guidance about digital security.

## email management

emails are key objects online. almost all online accounts are tied to an email.  

**recommendations for email management:** 
1. maintain two types of emails; secure and other. your secure email is strictly for important accounts and interactions. 
important accounts are those whose compromise would affect your material well-being; for example bank account, insurance, etc. 
the secure should be used for these types of important accounts and nothing else.
all other accounts, for example; store, news, social media should go in the other account. basically everything not directly tied to your material resources should go in a separate email account. 

2. use an encrypted email service, like [proton-mail](https://proton.me/mail).

## password management

1. use a password manager.

2. choose a [strong passphrase](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html) for the manager itself.

3. always choose a new password with every account or site. never re-use a password!

4. for all applications and sites where it is available, enable [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication).

## general

- avoid public or shared computers when doing anything important.
- never plug in any usb-device into your computer that isn't yours or comes from someone you don't seriously trust.

## secure your hardware

- encrypt your computers/devices hard-drive.
- this should be the first things you do when setting up a new device.
- your devices should not be accessible (from any state; off, sleep, locked screen) without a password.
- backup important data on your hardware, have both offline and cloud-based backups.
