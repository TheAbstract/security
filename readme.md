digital security guidelines in a world of mass surveillance.
these guidelines are not exhaustive, just things that should be seriously considered by anyone who cares about privacy and security.
be mindful that surveillance may come from both state and corporate actors. 

## pre-requisites

read the electronic frontier foundation's [surveillance self-defence resource](https://ssd.eff.org) page. 
this should be your main source for the most up todate guidance about digital security.

## email and password management

emails and passwords are key objects online. almost all online accounts are tied to an email.  

**recomendations for email management:** 
- maintain two types of emails; secure and other. your secure email is strictly for importaint accounts and interactions.
- importaint accounts are those whose compromise would affect your material wellbeing; for example bank account, insurance, etc.
- the secure should be used for these types of important accounts and nothing else.
- all other accounts, for example; store, news, social media should go in the other account. basically eveything not directly tied to your material resources should go in a seperate email account.
